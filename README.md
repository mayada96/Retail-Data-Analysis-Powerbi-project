# Retail Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository offers a comprehensive exploration of retail data, which has been meticulously prepared and analyzed for actionable insights. The dataset contains retail data with the following columns:
-	`bill`: Bill or invoice identifier
-	`merchandise id`: Identifier for merchandise
-	`product`: Product name
-	`quota`: Quantity of the product in the order
-	`amount`: Amount or price for the product
-	`customer id`: Customer identifier
-	`country`: Country of the customers


## Data Cleansing in SQL

Before conducting analysis and visualization, I performed data cleansing in SQL, which involved the following tasks:
-	Removing rows with null values.
-	Formatting columns to the appropriate data types.
-	Eliminating redundant values.
-	Ensuring data accuracy and consistency.


## Analysis and Visuals

-	Following the data cleansing, I conducted a thorough analysis and created visuals in Power BI to gain insights. The following analysis and visualizations were performed:

-	RFM Analysis: You used SQL to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

-	Retail Dashboard in Power BI: A retail dashboard was created in Power BI with the following visuals: 

-	Quantity Orders vs. Invoice Date: Shows the trend of quantity orders over time.
-	Total Sales vs. Invoice Date: Illustrates the total sales over time.
-	Highest Sold Product: Highlights the product that has the highest sales.
-	Country and Total/Average Revenue Table: Displays a table with country-wise total and average revenue.
-	Most Valuable Customer Using RFM Analysis: Identifies the most valuable customer based on RFM segments.
-	Total and Average Revenue by Month: Shows the total and average revenue for each month.
-	Number of Customers in Each RFM Score: Presents the count of customers in each RFM segment.
-	Filtering Options: Filters are provided in the dashboard to allow users to filter the data by year, month, and country, enabling them to focus on specific subsets of data.
